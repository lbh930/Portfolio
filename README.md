# Benhao Lu's Game Project

## Pet Engine 3D

Sep. 2024 - Present 
Pet Engine 3D is a lightweight, real-time rendering engine designed for visualization, customization, and interaction with 3D objects on the desktop. Powered by OpenGL. 
Think of it as a 3D-centric version of Wallpaper Engineâ€”transforming your screen into a dynamic space for immersive models and environments, beyond just animated 2D wallpapers. 
I am currently working on this project solely.
